# contamination-rate-program

## Description 
I attempted to create a program that calculates the contamination rates of stars using Gaia data.

## Progress
I have a program that calculates the contamination rate for a star (ContaminationRate.py). However, the numbers this program returns does not exactly match the true contamination rate value for a star. This could be an aperture issue. The FindBestAperture.py program finds the best aperture for each star in contratiolessthan10.xlsx and writes that best aperture value to the contratiolessthan10.xlsx file. This file might contain another aperture that might work better for these stars (the current aperture value that I've been using is 40 arc seconds). I believe that once the correct aperture is found, the numbers returned by my contamination rate program will match those in the MAST database.
